This project involves the building of a simple browser version of a sketchpad (sort of) made up of cells, which change color when hovered over. 

These are the skills learnt and/or demonstrated through this project:
- CSS grid for the layout and a nested grid for the sketchpad for easy generation, organization and re-sizing of the layout and sketchpad
- Attempt at using viewport units together with aspect ratio media queries to allow responsive sizing in both the horizontal and vertical axes
- Working with a color picker, colors, and gradients
- Event listeners to enable buttons to call functions, and to allow the sketchpad to respond to user actions (such as clicking on the sketchpad to enable drawing/hovering over a cell to color it)
- DOM methods to keep track of element properties for use in actions (such as darkening the color of a cell on repeated hovers)
- Keyframes, animation properties, and pseudo-elements to help simulate states with buttons and increase interactivity
- Custom prompts using the dialog tag in HTML
